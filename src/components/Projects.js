        <p className="summary">
          The project aims to streamline and enhance the process of book
          discovery by leveraging the capabilities of NoSQL database MongoDB's
          Full-Text Search and then see how it fares against SQL database
          PostgreSQL by comparing the efficiency of query execution and the
          complexity of query searches supported by both.
          <br />
          Tech stack used: Python, XML, XSLT, MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

        <h3>New Bit Level Positional Encryption Algorithm (NBPLEA - Ver 2)</h3>
        <p className="publishedDate">08/2020 - 04/2021</p>
        <p className="summary">
          As part of my bachelor thesis, I developed a new cryptographic
          algorithm, using Java as my codebase, that would encrypt and decrypt
          text files. The spectral analysis showed that the process is free from
          standard cryptography attacks namely brute force, known plaintext and
          differential attacks.
